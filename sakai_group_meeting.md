CompSci 290: Sakai Group Meeting
===================
### What group's meeting did you attend and when:
 The Morpheus for Fixers webinar on 2/24
### Generally, what topics were discussed at the meeting:
* One of the developers went through his proccess of fixing a bug
* I noted the following things during his presentation
 * He talked about using sass instead of css, its benifits
 * intro to the css for sakai, modifying display and all that
 * making changes to it and compiling it
 * imports into maven
 * customizing the display for uni
 * sass->modules>tools
 * css for each tool, accesing it
 * quick fix for mobile bug? 35 mins in\
 * what is he using in browser to emulate phone??
  * what is the bug?
  * how does he push fix
  * issue logging in google doc
 * Also, at the end he quickly mentioned some method for quickly rebuilding sakai once it's been changed. I need to go back and figure out what is was it could be very helpful.
 
### Specifically, provide some details about one topic discussed that you found interesting:
 * At about 50 minutes in, he gives a tip for getting things to compile faster when making changes in css. From what I can tell, he uses a custom script that just uses compass to compile the css directly into the tomcat folder instead of doing the whole build. This does seems to be a pretty developer optimized trick, and for us it might be better just to user the normal way and wait a few minutes. Also, when building he uses a script to do all the restarting of tomcat and mysql automatically

### Do you still think you are interesting is working on this topic later in the semester (why or why not):
Since working on bugs is fundemental to the course, yes!
