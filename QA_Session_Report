I went to the QA session in Bostock on 4/22. Jolie specifically asked a couple of us to test if we could get WebDav file uploading
working with Sakai, and I tested the intructions for Linux. I found that while the command line version worked fine, the GUI intructions
did not work as Ubuntu changed their file server connection GUI in Nautilus which made it difficult to use. After researching online
I found a solution, but could still not get it to work. As with most Linux bugs, it may or may not ever get fixed as the userbase
is so diverse and customized. 

After this we moved to testing JIRA's that had fixes posted to make sure that they still worked. While I was able to verify some of the 
fixes, I was not quite able to get a handle of the JIRA system, specifically how to confirm my testing.
